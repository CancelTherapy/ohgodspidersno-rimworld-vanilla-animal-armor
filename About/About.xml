	<description>&lt;color=orange&gt;Requires at least HugsLib 5.0.0 and Animal Gear 0.9.0&lt;/color&gt;\n

Version 0.9.0

Requires HugsLib and Animal Gear.

	Armor for all of your favorite vanilla animals

	The goal of this mod is to:
		- Add armor for all vanilla animals
		- Reduce number of craftables by establishing streamlined standards
			- Three tech levels (Plate, Flak, Power)
			- Three body parts: Fabric Clothing, Body Armor, Helmet
			- Armor is one size-fits-all for all animals
			- Matches human armor stats and crafting costs


	Currently Supports the Following Animals:

	Accessories: Megasloth, All Dogs, Wargs, Wolves, and Foxes
	Clothing: Megasloth, Thrumbo

	Plate Body Armor:
	Plate Helmet: Bears, Cat, Megasloth, Rhinoceros, Thrumbo, Wild Boar

	Flak Body Armor: Husky, Labrador Retriever

	Coming Soon:
		- Flak (Advanced) Helmets and Power Armor
		- All armors for all animals
		- More accessories


	This mod uses and modifies art assets from Animal Gear: Basic

	Loading other Animal Gear mods should not cause conflicts, but will probably result in redundant duplicates of some items.

	Special Thanks To:
		- Dylan for creating the excellent Animal Gear framework, as well as a few armor and accessory art assets
		- OnyxHeart for creating the dog gambeson, wolf armor, thrumbo armor, and bear armor art assets that I re-used and/or adapted for this mod
		- Everyone on the Rimworld/mod-development discord server who was there to answer questions and provide guidance
