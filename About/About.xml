A small mod that adds bear / wolf armor and scarfs for dogs ^^ (wolfs and wargs too) mostly to show the capabilities 
of my other mod Animal Gear: Base and as an example for people looking to add their own animal gear (which is not that much work, 
see the "Animal Gear: Base" description or the contents of this mod).

The armor is pretty helpful if you don't like your animals to get hurt or killed as easily in a raid.

You might need to add them to the outfit "Anything" or create a new outfit on the animal-tab.
